    <p class="post-container-item">Render blocking resources are static files, such as fonts, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, that are vital to the process of rendering a web page. When the browser encounters a render blocking resource, it stops downloading the rest of the resources until these critical files are processed. In the meantime, the entire rendering process is put on hold.</p> 
    <p class="post-container-item">On the other hand, non-render blocking resources don't postpone the rendering of the page. The browser can safely download them in the background after the initial page render. [...]</p>

    <p class="post-container-item">SOAP vs REST vs JSON are frequently mentioned acronyms when speaking about web services. While SOAP and REST are two leading approaches to transferring data over a network using API calls, JSON is a compact data format that RESTful web services can use.</p>
    <p class="post-container-item">Deciding whether you should create a SOAP vs REST API is an essential question if you are planning to provide a web service.
