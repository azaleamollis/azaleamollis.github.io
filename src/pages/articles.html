    <p class="post-container-item">Traditionally, applications have been developed as monoliths. This term describes how application code is compiled and delivered.</p>
    <p class="post-container-item">Monoliths are compiled and/or packaged into a single binary or a bundle of code, then deployed as a single unit. That single unit contains hundreds, sometimes thousands of lines of code. The functionality packed into that deployable artifact is most, if not all, of the functions of the application. [...]</p>

    <p class="post-container-item">Flexbox and CSS Grid are two CSS layout modules that have become mainstream in recent years. When to use which, is another question however.</p>
    <p class="post-container-item">Both allow us to create complex layouts that were previously only possible by applying CSS hacks and/or JavaScript. Flexbox and CSS Grid share multiple similarities and many layouts can be solved with both. Let’s see if we can clarify when you should use Flexbox vs. Grid. [...]</p>

      <p class="post-container-item">As the digital age continues to shape our lives, introducing coding to the next generation has evolved into a booming industry. Just consider the coding apps for kids, educational toys and robots, specialized handbooks, textbooks, coding competitions, and tutoring services available today.</p>

      <p class="post-container-item">When a website loads files over the HTTP protocol, these files are typically compressed to reduce the amount of data that's transferred. That in turn means that less time is spent downloading the file.</p>
      <p class="post-container-item">For repeated visits, files that have been downloaded previously can be served from the browser cache. However, developers continuously make changes to these files, and they need to be downloaded again, even though the files are very similar.</p> 
      <p class="post-container-item">Shared compression dictionaries solve this problem. Even if a file has been updated, some previously downloaded data can be re-used, thus reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred on a subsequent visit.[...]</p>

    <p class="post-container-item">SOAP vs REST vs JSON are frequently mentioned acronyms when speaking about web services. While SOAP and REST are two leading approaches to transferring data over a network using API calls, JSON is a compact data format that RESTful web services can use.</p>
    <p class="post-container-item">Deciding whether you should create a SOAP vs REST API is an essential question if you are planning to provide a web service. Each architectural style has its own use cases, benefits, and limitations. In this article, we'll look into both the SOAP protocol and the REST guidelines in detail and also see how JSON fits into the landscape. [...]</p>
