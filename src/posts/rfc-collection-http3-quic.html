<p>The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/">RFC (Request for Comments) Series</a> is a numbered collection of technical specifications that standardize many of the procedures and protocols used in internet-based systems, including the well-known communication protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite, e.g. HTTP, QUIC, UDP, TCP, and others.</p>

<p>While the RFC Series is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/search/rfc_search_detail.php">available for anyone to peruse</a>, and each RFC has its own number, it's not always easy to find all the RFCs related to a particular subject.</p>

<p>The catalog below includes the most important RFCs related to the recently published HTTP/3 and QUIC protocols, the previous versions of HTTP, and the underlying transport-layer and security protocols (QUIC, UDP, and TCP for transport and TLS for security).</p>
---
<p>Note that the RFCs below have been selected arbitrarily, and there may exist other relevant specifications, too, that are not included in the list.</p> 

<p>The RFCs are listed in numeric order.</p>

<h2>Status: Internet Standard</h2>
<blockquote><p>&quot;A specification for which significant implementation and successful
   operational experience has been obtained may be elevated to the
   Internet Standard level.  An Internet Standard (which may simply be
   referred to as a Standard) is characterized by a high degree of
   technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified
   protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet
   community.</p><p>A specification that reaches the status of Standard is assigned a
   number in the STD Series while retaining its RFC number.&quot;</p><p class="bq-source">Definition of an Internet Standard &ndash; <cite><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2026.html#section-4.1.3">RFC 2026, 4.1.3</a></cite></p>

<h2>Status: Proposed Standard</h2>

<blockquote><p>&quot;A Proposed Standard specification is generally stable, has resolved
   known design choices, is believed to be well-understood, has received
   significant community review, and appears to enjoy enough community
   interest to be considered valuable.  However, further experience
   might result in a change or even retraction of the specification
   before it advances.&quot;</p><p class="bq-source">Definition of a Proposed Standard &ndash; <cite><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2026.html#section-4.1.1">RFC 2026, 4.1.1</a></cite></p>
